Working with Branches
Git allows you to work on different branches simultaneously. Here's how to create and switch branches:
Create a new branch:

git checkout -b <branch_name>

Switch to an existing branch:
  git checkout <branch_name>

Making and Committing Changes
   After making changes to your files, you can commit them using these steps:

Add changes to the staging area:

git add <file_name>
Commit changes:
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
